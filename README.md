### Content
This GitHub repository hosts the 3D printing files and code associated with the research article "Frustration and Emergence in Spinner Ices and Glasses". The repository serves as an open-source resource to support replication, customization, and further exploration of the macroscopic experimental platform described in the paper.

The project presents an innovative approach to studying frustrated magnetic systems—specifically spin ices and spin glasses—through mechanical analogs called spinners. These rotators, embedded with permanent magnets, are arranged in various lattice configurations to emulate magnetic frustration and glassy behavior. The platform allows for the controlled study of dipolar interactions, emergent excitations, and complex energy landscapes at room temperature and on a tangible, human scale.

Included in the repository are:

- STL files and design templates for 3D printing spinner components and lattice holders.
- Code for simulation and analysis of spinner configurations.

This repository supports broader accessibility to experimental frustrated systems and encourages interdisciplinary engagement in areas such as condensed matter physics, mechanical computing, and emergent complexity.
